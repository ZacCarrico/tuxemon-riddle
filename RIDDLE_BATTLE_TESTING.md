## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå "No riddles found" Error
- **Cause**: Riddle database not loaded properly
- **Solution**: Check that riddle JSON files exist in `mods/tuxemon/db/riddle/`

### ‚ùå "Animation not found" Error  
- **Cause**: Riddle techniques reference invalid animations
- **Solution**: Animations set to `null` in riddle technique files

### ‚ùå Translation Errors
- **Cause**: Missing translations for riddle UI elements
- **Solution**: Compile translations with `msgfmt base.po -o base.mo`

### ‚ùå AI Not Using Riddles
- **Cause**: AI still using old technique system
- **Solution**: Verify `riddle_ai.py` is imported and used in `ai.py`

### ‚ùå Input Not Working
- **Cause**: Event handling issues in riddle state
- **Solution**: Check that `process_event` method handles keyboard input properly
