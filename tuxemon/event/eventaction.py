@dataclass
class EventAction(ABC):
    """EventActions are executed during gameplay.

    EventAction subclasses implement "actions" defined in Tuxemon maps.
    All subclasses, at minimum, must implement the following:

    * The EventAction.start() method
    * A meaningful name, which must match the name in map file actions

    By populating the "valid_parameters" class attribute, subclasses
    will be assigned a "parameters" instance attribute that holds the
    parameters passed to the action in the map file.  It is also used
    to check the syntax of actions, by verifying the correct type and
    number of parameters passed.

    If an EventAction does not implement the update method, it will only
    run for one frame.  If it does implement the update method, then it
    will continue to run until it is stopped, or the EventEngine is stopped.

    If you wish to stop an EventAction, call the stop method.  Calling
    stop() signals to the EventEngine that this EventAction is done,
    and can be removed from the processing loop at the end of the frame.

    Update will be called every frame the EventAction is running,
    including the first frame it is started.  You should eventually
    stop the action during update.

    The EventAction class supports the context protocol, and you may
    also use them outside of the EventEngine, but can only be run
    in a blocking manner.  Do not execute EventActions outside the Engine
    if the action will block forever, as it will freeze the game.


    **Parameters**

    ** this is a work-in-progress feature, that may change in time **

    Tuxemon supports type-checking of the parameters defined in the maps.

    valid_parameters may be the following format (may change):

    (type, name)

    * the type may be any valid python type, or even a python class or function
    * type may be a single type, or a tuple of types
    * type, if a tuple, may include None to indicate the parameter is optional
    * name must be a valid python string

    After parsing the parameters of the MapAction, the parameter's value
    will be passed to the type constructor.

    Example types: str, int, float, Monster, Item

    (int, "duration")                => duration must be an int
    ((int, float), "duration")       => can be an int or float
    ((int, float, None), "duration") => is optional

    (Monster, "monster_slug")   => a Monster instance will be created

    Parameters:
        session: Object containing the session information.
        parameters: Parameters of the action.
